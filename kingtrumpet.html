<p><h3>The Ultimate Guide to King Trumpet Mushrooms:</h3>
The Gourmet’s Choice for Texture and Taste  
King trumpet mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii), also known as king oyster mushrooms, are loved for their thick, meaty stems and mild umami flavor. They are prized in Mediterranean and Asian cuisines alike for their versatility and satisfying bite.</p>

<p><h3>Appearance & Storage</h3>
They feature fat, cylindrical white stems with a small brown cap. Store in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to 7–10 days. Keep dry for maximum shelf life.</p>

<p><h3>Nutritional Benefits</h3>
Low in calories and high in protein, fiber, B-vitamins, potassium, and antioxidants like ergothioneine. They support immune health and may help reduce cholesterol.</p>

<p><h3>Culinary Uses</h3>
Ideal for slicing into "scallop-style" rounds or strips and grilling or pan-frying. Their firmness makes them great for skewers, stir-fries, or vegan steak alternatives.</p>

<p><h3>Recipe Ideas & Tips</h3>
Try roasted king trumpet rounds in garlic butter, stir-fried with soy and sesame, or seared like scallops. Their dense structure soaks up marinades beautifully.</p>

<p><h3>How to Prepare</h3>
Wipe with a damp cloth. Slice into rounds, planks, or strips. Cook on high heat to bring out flavor and chewiness.</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
King trumpet mushrooms offer a gourmet experience with nutrition to match. Their unique texture elevates plant-based and meat dishes alike.</p>
