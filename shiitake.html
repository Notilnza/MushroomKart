<p><h3>The Ultimate Guide to Shiitake Mushrooms:</h3>
A Nutrient-Packed Medicinal Marvel
Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) have been used in Asian cuisine and medicine for centuries. Known for their distinct smoky flavor and chewy texture, they add depth to dishes while offering notable health benefits.</p>

<p><h3>Appearance & Storage</h3>
They have umbrella-shaped brown caps with white stems. Store in a breathable bag in the fridge and use within 5–7 days. Dried shiitakes are also widely available and have a longer shelf life.</p>

<p><h3>Nutritional Benefits</h3>
Rich in B vitamins, selenium, and polysaccharides like lentinan, which supports immune health. They also offer compounds that promote heart health and may reduce inflammation.</p>

<p><h3>Culinary Uses</h3>
Popular in Asian dishes like miso soup, stir-fried noodles, and dumpling fillings. Their umami flavor enhances broths and sauces.</p>

<p><h3>Recipe Ideas & Tips</h3>
Try them in ramen, sautéed with soy sauce, or grilled on skewers. Use dried shiitakes for a more intense flavor profile.</p>

<p><h3>How to Prepare</h3>
Remove tough stems before cooking. Slice caps and sauté, steam, or simmer. Rehydrate dried ones in warm water for 30 minutes.</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
Shiitake mushrooms bring flavor, texture, and nutritional power to the table. A must-have in both modern and traditional kitchens.</p>
