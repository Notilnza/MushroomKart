<p><h3>The Ultimate Guide to Milky Mushrooms:</h3>
Nature’s Tropical Mushroom
Milky mushrooms (Calocybe indica) are native to India and thrive in warm, humid climates. Known for their thick white stems and caps, they are sturdy, long-lasting, and ideal for both fresh use and commercial cultivation. Their mild flavor and firm texture make them perfect for stir-fries, curries, and grills.</p>

<p><h3>Appearance & Storage</h3>
They have a clean, white appearance and broad cap with thick stalks. Store them in a paper bag or wrapped in newspaper in the fridge; they stay fresh for 5–7 days. Avoid moisture to prevent spoilage.</p>

<p><h3>Nutritional Benefits</h3>
Milky mushrooms are high in protein, vitamin B12, and essential minerals like potassium and phosphorus. They also possess antioxidant and potential antiviral properties. Their high fiber aids digestion and promotes overall gut health.</p>

<p><h3>Culinary Uses</h3>
Their firmness holds up well in sautéing, deep frying, or grilling. Use them in Indian gravies, mushroom masala, or toss into stir-fries. They also work well in mushroom rice or pilaf recipes.</p>

<p><h3>Recipe Ideas & Tips</h3>
Try them in creamy mushroom curry or marinated and grilled as a tandoori snack. Their texture also makes them good for stuffing or frying as crispy bites.</p>

<p><h3>How to Prepare</h3>
Clean with a dry cloth or brush. Chop into bite-sized pieces before cooking. Avoid soaking, as they absorb water quickly.</p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
Milky mushrooms are nutritious, adaptable, and easy to cook. Their long shelf life and health benefits make them a fantastic ingredient for tropical cuisine and beyond.</p>
